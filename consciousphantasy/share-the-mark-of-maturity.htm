            These verses mean that "Vietnamese are still immature even
            though the country has a cultural of 4.000 years old." There is a
            question that how could we know if a person is immature or mature?
            This blog entry tries to answer that question and also introduces
            some recommended skills for a mature person should be learned.

		        Above verses mean that "Vietnamese are still immature even
		        though the country has a cultural of 4.000 years old". 潘周楨,
		        a Vietnamese though about ethics and moral. He claims that
		        Vietnam should follow democracy policy which also is similar to
		        Chinese 孟子 though (a school of Confucianism). 孟子 claims that
                                          民為貴，社稷次之，君為輕 which means that people is most important
                then country and finally the king of country. He expects that
                Vietnamese should be conservative, keep their traditional moral
                which base on Confucianism beliefs and values. There are five
                virtues should be archived:
            </div>
            <div class="lindent0a">
			    Rén (仁, benevolence, humaneness);
            </div>
            <div class="lindent0a">
                Yì (義, righteousness or justice);

            <div>
	            Vietnamese are still immature because they depend to the king
	            or a leader to follow ethics but not build their own moral.
	            He claims that ethics may be chanced but the moral is constant,
	            and Vietnamese does not build this moral well. A mature person
	            should possess above five virtues. And the marks of maturity
	            are:
            </div>
            <div class="lindent0a">
                Person's behaviors should follow ethics not person's desire.

            <div class="lindent0a">

            <div class="lindent0a">
