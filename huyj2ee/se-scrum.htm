            Scrum is an agile framework for developing, delivering, and
            sustaining complex products. It is designed for teams of ten or
            fewer members, who break their work into goals that can be
            completed within timeboxed iterations. The Scrum Team track
            progress in 15-minute time-boxed daily meetings. At the end of
            a iteration, the team holds review and retrospective to
            continuously improve.

            Problems are inevitable, because our knowledge will always be
            infinitely far from complete. Problems are soluble, and each
            particular evil is a problem that can be solved. Let's
            investigate problems and knowledge in some following
            software methodologies.

                    For waterfall methodology, software requirements
                    (Figure 1, <i>Requirements</i> of the waterfall model) are
                    analyzed by a Business Analyzer captured in a product

                    disagrees that knowledge is collection of observations,
                    nor with the invention of experiments. The reason is that
                    observations and experiments are biased. Knowledge is
                    conjecture alternating with criticism. Such knowledge is
                    archived after <i>Verification</i> of the waterfall model
                    (Figure 1). This means that we have knowledge after the
                    product is released. There are two type of knowledge:

                <div class="lindent0a">

                    Waterfall methodology is suitable for case that such
                    knowledge is straightforward (where requirements and scope
                    are fixed, the product itself is firm and stable, and
                    the technology is clearly understood.).

            <div>
                To support team archive knowledge, iterative incremental model
                is introduced. The requirements are broken down and they are
                being evoluted. They are added over iterations. An iteration is
                similar to waterfall model, it releases an outcome called as
                <i>Software Product Increment</i>. The requirements are broken
                down and evoluted so that the knowledge required for the early
                iteration is straightforward. After each iteration, we "earn"
                more knowledge that is ready for next requirement evolution.
                We base on the <i>Software Product Increment</i> to define
                the next <i>Requirements</i> (select which pending requirement
                to put into next iteration implementation list, add new
                requirement or modify an existing requirement).

                The outcome of the subsequent iteration is an enhanced working

                Iterative incremental model assumes that customer could
                correctly describe the requirement. The requirement is not
                expected to be changed. However, it is common that requirement
                is changed. Agile methodology encourages this. It is based on

                Agile is a methodology, while Scrum is a framework. It is a
                partial solution for complex adaptive problems, while
                productively and creatively delivering products of the
                highest possible value.

                The Scrum framework consists of Scrum Teams and their
                associated roles, events, artifacts, and rules. Each
                component within the framework serves a specific purpose
                and is essential to Scrum’s success and usage.

            <div>
                The rules of Scrum bind together the events, roles, and
                artifacts, governing the relationships and interaction
                between them.
