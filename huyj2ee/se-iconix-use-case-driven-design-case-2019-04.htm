                Lines 98 is a simple interesting classical game. The game is
                composed by balls generated on a board that player could make a
                ball moving. To do scores, player must arrange 5 or more balls
                of the same colour consecutively in straight lines (vertically,
                horizontally or diagonally). The game is started by a page
                load/refresh or a reset button clicked by player. After reseting,
                3 new balls is generated, then player could move a ball. After
                reseting, there are only 3 balls existed, so no scores is done
                after this first ball moving. If there is no scores done after
                a moving ball, 3 new balls is generated, then player could make
                a new ball moving. If this new moving results in 5 or more balls
                of the same colour consecutively are in straight lines, scores
                are done (all balls do score will be removed), and new scores is
                displayed on the score board. In the case of scores done, there
                is no new balls generated, player could make a new ball moving
                then. If player's total scores reach to a preset limitation,
                player wins a price which results in web page will show some
                hidden content that is meaningful to player. The score is
                computed as following:
